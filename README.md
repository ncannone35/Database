The database has been initialized with the tuples provided from the textbook.  It will first demonstrate part 1 by testing the insert, delete, and lookup methods.  It will then prompt the user in order to run the query that answers the questions asked in part 2.  Input the required strings exactly as they would be inputed in the database.  Part 3 is then demonstrated on the required examples.
